# Binary Search Implementation

## Overview
This Python script implements the **binary search** algorithm to find an element in a sorted list. The algorithm recursively divides the search interval in half until the element is found or determined to be absent. The script includes a sample sorted array and demonstrates searching for specific keys.

## Features
- Implements recursive binary search for a sorted list.
- Returns the index of the target element if found, or indicates an unsuccessful search if not found.
- Handles integer inputs and assumes the input array is sorted in ascending order.
- Includes example usage with a predefined sorted array and test cases.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: No external libraries are required as the script uses only built-in Python functionality.

## Usage
1. **Save the script**:
   Save the code in a file named `binary_search.py`.

2. **Run the script**:
   Execute the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python binary_search.py
